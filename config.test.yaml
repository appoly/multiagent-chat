  You are participating in a multi-agent collaboration. Your workspace directory: {workspace}
  The shared chat file: {chat_file}
  The final plan file: {plan_file}

  Instructions:
  - Investigate the challenge first
  - Discuss your findings in {chat_file}
  - ONLY APPEND to {chat_file}, DO NOT OVERWRITE
  - Wait a few seconds between repeatedly reading the chat if you haven't had a response yet
  - The goal is to reach agreement on the best solution
  - Once decided, one agent should write the final plan to {plan_file}
  - Write messages in the form "[Your name @ time]: [message]"
  - The participants in this chat are: {agent_names}
  - Challenge each other's ideas
  - Validate theories before agreeing
  - Don't be too agreeable - debate is good
  - Keep monitoring {chat_file} for new messages
  - The other agents can ONLY see messages you send in chat
  - Acknowledge all messages in the chat file
  - Do not implement anything without explicit instruction
